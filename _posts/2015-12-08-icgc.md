Vincent Ferretti and his team over at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research have recently integrated bam.iobio into their really awesome data portal (<a href='https://dcc.icgc.org/repositories/files/FI9974'>see it here</a>). The data portal pulls together data from many groups that are part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and is very well done. I especially like the <a href='https://dcc.icgc.org/search'>search page</a>, which gives some nice pie charts on project-level data metrics.

It's really intersting to see how well iobio works with data portals, which tend to not store their data locally. The ICGC data portal is displaying info on data from different institutions all over the world. Since iobio remotely samples data files, the  ICGC data portal can analyze and visualize this remote data without any downloading or major processing, which would probably require some complex backend code. Another perk is that all samples are instantly able to be visualized as soon as a member organization uploads some data, since it's happening in real-time.
